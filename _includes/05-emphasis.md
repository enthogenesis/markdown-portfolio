Firstly, for ego inflation issues, I feel deeply uncomfortable using the adjective awesome to describe anything about myself, it seems just so 'American" to do so. However, it seems that:

* I love my family.
* I'm a **natural** teacher.
* I'm **seriously enthused by programming, science and tech** and the possibilites of **DL**.
* I'm *dedicated* towards manifesting what I can of them in the time left to me to help others and this planet.
* I *love* to learn.
* I love kindness and those who are kind.

This is seriously **exciting**!*.
