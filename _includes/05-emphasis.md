Disclaimer: An excercise in using emphasis in markdown!

Firstly, for ego inflation issues, I feel deeply uncomfortable using the adjective 'awesome' to describe anything about myself. However, it seems that:

* I love my family.
* A **natural** teacher, I seem to be.
* Later in life, unusually **enthused by code, science and tech** and the possibilites of **DL**.

This is uncommonly **exciting**!
