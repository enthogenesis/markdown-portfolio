Firstly, for ego inflation issues, I feel deeply uncomfortable using the adjective awesome to describe anything about myself, it seems just so 'American" to do so. However, it seems that:

* I'm a *natural* teacher.
* I'm now **seriously enthused by programming** and the possibilites of **DL**.
* I *love* to learn.
